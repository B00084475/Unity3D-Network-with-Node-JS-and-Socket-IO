#### Unity3D-Network-with-Node-JS-and-Socket-IO
A practice to movement of 3D characters based on a network system. (Unity 3D, Node JS, Socket IO)

Throughout these repository, I'll make practice about how to create my multiplayer game with a dedicated server driven by NodeJs. This will be built on top of websockets so that it is responsive allowing for real-time multiplayer game play.

#### What includes that project?? 

- The client will control a character.
- I'll find a free asset from Unity asset store for animation mecanims like idle, run, attack etc.
- I'll find a free 3D character asset from Unity asset store. 
- I'll implement run, attack animations. 
- Other viewers(clients) can see player movements or actions like running or attacking in the room.
- I'll implement Health and Damage system.
- I'll implement a Player death logic.
- I'll improve Anti-Hacking with Server Authorative Code.
- I'll handle and cover some hacks stuff like if Player hack their position what should we do? something like that.
